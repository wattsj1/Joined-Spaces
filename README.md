Joined Spaces

Joinery is used in architecture to create structure and spaces. For structure, two elements interlock with each other to create a strong support. A joint can have multiple connections for structure.  For space, surfaces touch, interlock or separate to produce a space and form. It also creates different voids and solids. In Tomba Brion by Carlo Scarpa, the project explores with interlocking elements to define the space. In architecture joinery is usually hidden. Architecture software are today have allowed joinery to become more complex and opens to new ways elements are bonded. I propose developing a plugin that explores the use of joinery to produce form and becomes the way an object takes shape. This tool allows the user to create a joined space and highlights the joint used to connect it. It will help the user to create different types of forms based off the joinery and scatter the spaces to expose how the joint changed the space. Using virtual reality allows to user to interact with the model and help understand the connection between joints and space.
